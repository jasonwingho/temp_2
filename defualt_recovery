Feature: Default recovery strategy for unhandled states
  As a system administrator
  I want a fallback strategy for orders in unexpected states
  So that the system can handle all possible scenarios during recovery

  Background:
    Given the system is in recovery mode
    And the transaction logs are available

  Scenario: Order with unknown state uses default strategy
    Given an order with ID "ORD-UNKNOWN" exists in transaction logs
    And the order has state "UnknownState" in RECALL/TICKET/HISTORY topic
    When the recovery process runs for this order
    Then the DefaultRecoveryStrategy should handle the order
    And the recovery action should be REBUILD with warning about unknown state
    And the order should be rebuilt in the cache with state "UnknownState"

  Scenario: Order with missing transaction history is handled by default strategy
    Given an order with ID "ORD-MISSING" exists in transaction logs
    And the order has state "MissingState" in RECALL/TICKET/HISTORY topic
    And the order has state "SomeOtherState" in RECALL/TO/OMS topic
    When the recovery process runs for this order
    Then the DefaultRecoveryStrategy should handle the order
    And the recovery action should be REBUILD with warning about unknown state
    And the order should be rebuilt in the cache with state "MissingState"

  Scenario: Order with custom state not handled by other strategies
    Given an order with ID "ORD-CUSTOM" exists in transaction logs
    And the order has state "CustomState" in RECALL/TICKET/HISTORY topic
    And the order has state "CustomState" in RECALL/TO/OMS topic
    And the order has state "CustomState" in OMS/TO/RECALL topic 
    When the recovery process runs for this order
    Then the DefaultRecoveryStrategy should handle the order
    And the recovery action should be REBUILD with warning about unknown state
    And the order should be rebuilt in the cache with state "CustomState"
